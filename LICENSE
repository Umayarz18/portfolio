Feel free to use this code for inspiration and a resource for building your own
projects.

I have intentionally overengineered my site to be a reference for up-and-coming
developers to explore a codebase with different parts (linting, components, using a Headless CMS, git hooks, etc.).

If you use this code, please acknowledge this source and help pay it forward by
helping other developers along with their journeys.

This codebase was made with inspiration and code from the following sources:

- Lee Robinson
- Julia Tan
- TailwindUI Components
- HeadlessUI Components
- The countless developers in the community that helped make the packages and
  frameworks my site was made possible with.
