# Roewyn's Portfolio

A unnecessarily complex personal site because I need a place to learn things.

## Purpose

I've made my personal website available for viewing to act as a resource for
aspiring developers to strike inspirations for their own projects. I have intentionally (and unintentionally) over-engineered my website so visitors can
view latest trends or intermediate topics without being intimidated by a big repository. This repo is perfect for early-stage developers wanting to dive into
more complex ideas with a familar site.

## Stack

This website was made with several packages, frameworks, and tools that were put in to try out different concepts in web development:

- `Next.js`: A React framework best for SEO, performance, and developer experience with React
- `Sanity.io`: A Headless CMS that gives you freedom to structure Content in a configured interface
- `Typescript`: Helps make code consistent and eliminate bugs before they can happen
- `TailwindCSS`: A utility CSS framework to make Responsiveness + Styling nicer
- `Github Actions`: To (eventually) automate testing + MISC tasks for Continuous Integration
- `Husky`: Helps check code for formatting and linting with git hooks
- `ESLint`: Stop bugs, problems, and enforce code style
- `lint-staged`: Makes sure code follows our format before commits are made
- `prettier`: Code formatting for consistency
- `Splitbee.io`: Web analytics
