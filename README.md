# Roewyn's Portfolio

A unnecessarily complex personal site because I need a place to learn things.

## Purpose

I've made my personal website available for viewing to act as a resource for
aspiring developers to strike inspirations for their own projects. I have intentionally (and unintentionally) over-engineered my website so visitors can
view latest trends or intermediate topics without being intimidated by a big repository. This repo is perfect for early-stage developers wanting to dive into
more complex ideas with a familar site.
