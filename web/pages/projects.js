            I continually work on projects to learn new things in web
            development. Most of my work is done for organization or to
            prototype ideas that have promise to do a lot of good. Other times,
            they exist only to meme around with a new technology or concept ðŸ¤¡.

              techniques learned from a breakdown of Lee Robinson's website and
